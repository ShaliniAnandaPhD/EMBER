# EmberMind: AI-Driven Wildfire Risk Assessment and Mitigation

EmberMind is an AI-driven wildfire risk assessment and mitigation system that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict and respond to wildfires effectively. The system utilizes data from various sources, including satellite imagery, weather data, sensor networks, and historical wildfire records, to provide accurate and timely insights for wildfire management and sustainability.

## Features
- Data collection and integration from multiple sources
- Mapping neuron activation patterns using sparse autoencoders
- Predictive modeling for wildfire occurrence, spread, and intensity
- AI-driven decision support for resource allocation and emergency response
- Automated communication system for alerts and notifications

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/EMBER.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the data collection script: `python data_collection.py`
4. Preprocess the collected data: `python data_preprocessing.py`
5. Train the sparse autoencoder: `python autoencoder.py`
