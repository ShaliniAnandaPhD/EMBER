# **File Structure**

### **emberorg.py**
This file serves as the central application for the EMBER system, developed using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface. It integrates multiple system components, including risk assessment, route optimization, and instruction generation, to deliver personalized evacuation recommendations. The application dynamically processes user inputs, retrieves relevant geospatial and real-time hazard data, and visualizes evacuation scenarios on an interactive map. Additionally, it includes a feedback mechanism that enables users to rate the generated instructions, contributing to continuous system refinement.

### **risk_assessment.py**
This module implements the `RiskAssessmentAgent` class, which is responsible for evaluating the relative risk levels of various evacuation zones. The agent employs a pre-trained risk assessment model to analyze geospatial data and real-time wildfire conditions, prioritizing evacuation efforts based on hazard severity and population vulnerability. The goal is to ensure that high-risk areas receive expedited guidance and intervention.

### **route_optimization.py**
The `RouteOptimizationAgent` class, defined in this module, is designed to compute the most efficient and safest evacuation routes. The algorithm integrates real-time traffic conditions, geographical constraints, and fire progression models to dynamically adjust routes, minimizing exposure to hazards while optimizing travel time. This approach enhances evacuation efficiency and reduces congestion in high-risk areas.

### **instruction_generation.py**
The `InstructionGenerationAgent` class constitutes a core component of the system, facilitating the generation of personalized evacuation instructions. This module leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to transform optimized route data into clear and context-aware evacuation directives. The system incorporates reinforcement learning mechanisms to iteratively refine instruction clarity, specificity, and effectiveness based on user feedback.

### **scoring.py**
This module provides a structured evaluation framework for ranking evacuation instructions. The scoring function applies a weighted system that considers safety, specificity, clarity, and user feedback. By systematically ranking instructions, this approach ensures that users receive the most relevant and actionable recommendations.

### **visualization.py**
The `visualize_instructions_on_map` function, implemented within this module, enables the graphical representation of evacuation plans. Using the Folium library, this function integrates geospatial data, fire perimeters, recommended routes, and generated instructions into an interactive map interface. This visualization aids decision-making by providing an intuitive and comprehensive overview of the evacuation scenario.

# **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Approaches**

### **Wildfire_RAG.py**
This module defines the `WildfireRAG` class, an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for wildfire evacuation guidance. It integrates document retrieval from an Elasticsearch index with a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for dynamic instruction generation. The system is deployed via FastAPI, facilitating real-time access to evacuation recommendations through an API interface.

### **WildfireEvacPipeline.py**
The `WildfireEvacPipeline` class implements a structured pipeline for generating wildfire evacuation instructions. It employs a sentence-transformer model for efficient document retrieval and a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for instruction synthesis. By dynamically retrieving relevant documents from an indexed corpus, this approach enhances the contextual relevance of generated instructions.

### **WildFireEvacRAG.py**
This module defines a two-stage RAG approach for evacuation instruction generation. In the retrieval phase, BM25 scoring is used to extract the most relevant documents from a pre-indexed dataset. The retrieved data, along with user queries, are processed by a fine-tuned BART model in the generation stage, ensuring high accuracy and contextual alignment. The system is designed for command-line execution, offering flexibility in deployment.

# **Supporting Modules**

### **RAG.py**
The `WildfireEvacuationRAG` class integrates document retrieval, instruction synthesis, and reinforcement learning. It employs a sentence-transformer model for document retrieval, a GPT-2 model for text generation, and a BERT-based ranking model to optimize instruction quality. The inclusion of reinforcement learning enables continuous adaptation based on user interactions.

### **LlamaIndexQA.py**
This module explores the potential of the LlamaIndex library for generating evacuation instructions. It constructs a document index using the `GPTSimpleVectorIndex` and applies query-based retrieval mechanisms to extract relevant responses. The indexed dataset incorporates critical contextual information, such as terrain characteristics, emergency exits, and past wildfire scenarios, to generate precise evacuation guidance.

### **rl_framework.py**
The `RLAgent` class serves as a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing evacuation instructions. It integrates a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to quantify user feedback and assigns reward values accordingly. Using policy gradient methods, the agent iteratively refines instruction-generation parameters, ensuring that the system evolves toward improved clarity and effectiveness.
