    Custom environment for adaptive weather forecasting using reinforcement learning.

    to update and adjust forecasting models based on new incoming data and changing environmental conditions.

    Reward:
        Reward is based on the accuracy of the weather forecast compared to the actual weather conditions.

    Starting State:
        The initial weather conditions are randomly generated.

    Episode Termination:
        The episode terminates after a fixed number of steps.
