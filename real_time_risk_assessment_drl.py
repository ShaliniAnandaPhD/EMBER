class RiskAssessmentEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    Custom environment for real-time risk assessment using deep reinforcement learning.

    The environment simulates risk scenarios where the agent needs to make decisions to minimize risk.

    Observation:
        Type: Box(4)
        Num    Observation               Min            Max

        0      Maintain Current Risk Level
        1      Increase Risk Level
        2      Decrease Risk Level

    Reward:
        Reward is based on the appropriateness of the risk level adjustment decision.
        A correct decision yields a positive reward, while an incorrect decision results in a negative reward.

    Starting State:
        The initial risk factors and risk level are randomly generated.

    Episode Termination:
        The episode terminates after a fixed number of steps.
